			I deeply appreciate Chase’s desire to refresh orthodoxy for the modern reader.
His commitment to the Gospel is clear, his ability to nuance spiritual truths with story is well-crafted, and the outcome of watching men like him fill the shoes God places them in is timely.  <span>— Heath Adamson: Author, Speaker, & Advocate. Chief of Staff, Convoy of Hope</span>
